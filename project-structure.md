# 🧱 AzothSolver Project Structure (OSS Ecosystem)

This document provides an overview of the **AzothSolver open-source ecosystem**. Each component is a standalone OSS project, designed to provide tooling, experimentation, and high-performance infrastructure for decentralized systems.

---

## 📦 Components Overview

### 1. `documentation/`

Central hub for all technical references, including:

* `README.md`: Overview of the ecosystem and development roadmap.
* `architecture.md`: Design of modular OSS tools (including AzothBalancer).
* `projects/`: Notes and guidelines for individual projects and integrations.
* `assets/documents/`: Whitepapers, diagrams, and other reference material.

This repo helps contributors understand the ecosystem’s structure and rationale.

---

### 2. `website/`

Frontend landing page for AzothSolver ecosystem, hosted at [azothsolver-web.vercel.app](https://azothsolver-web.vercel.app). Features:

* Clean, mobile-friendly design.
* Pages: `index.html`, `projects.html`, `community.html`.
* Links to:

  * Documentation
  * OSS projects (AzothBalancer, solver modules, future tools)
  * Socials (X/Twitter)
* Static hosting via Vercel, Netlify, or GitHub Pages.

---

### 3. `azoth-balancer/`

Rust-based RPC load balancer. Implements:

* Tiered endpoint routing
* Health monitoring & failover
* Rate-limiting and batch handling
* Metrics via Prometheus

Design emphasizes **reliability and low latency** for blockchain infrastructure and solver environments.

---

### 4. `solver/` *(in progress, private or soon public)*

Modular solver module for decentralized systems (initially CoW Protocol, eventually generalizable):

* Pathfinding & order matching engine
* Objective scoring & evaluation logic
* Solution submission interface

Designed as a **performance-oriented, pluggable OSS component** with potential for wider adoption.

---

### 5. Future Projects

* New OSS modules under AzothSolver ecosystem:

  * Blockchain experimentation tools
  * Rust back-end libraries
  * Dev tooling and infrastructure utilities
