# üß± AzothSolver Architecture Overview

This document outlines the core modules and design principles behind the **AzothSolver ecosystem**‚Äîa modular, high-performance open-source framework for decentralized systems, blockchain tooling, and backend infrastructure.

## üì¶ Core Modules

### 1. **Data Ingestion / Event Listener**

* Subscribes to data sources via HTTP, WebSocket, or other transport layers.
* Decodes raw input into internal structured formats for downstream processing.
* Designed to support multiple protocols, APIs, or blockchain networks.

### 2. **Computation / Algorithm Engine**

* Core logic for processing, transforming, and analyzing ingested data.
* Supports plug-in algorithm strategies and experimental modules.
* Modular design allows integration of custom heuristics, pathfinding, or optimization strategies.

### 3. **Evaluation & Scoring**

* Applies validation and scoring rules to generated outputs.
* Supports modular evaluation strategies, including:

  * Resource or cost efficiency
  * Performance or throughput optimization
  * Custom business or protocol-specific criteria

### 4. **Output Adapter / Formatter**

* Converts computed results into the required format for downstream systems.
* Supports multiple output channels (APIs, connectors, databases, dashboards).

### 5. **Connector / Dispatcher**

* Handles delivery of outputs with retry, throttling, or batching logic.
* Ensures high reliability under load, respecting rate limits and priority channels.

### 6. **Telemetry & Observability**

* Exposes real-time metrics via Prometheus or compatible systems.
* Monitors latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.
* Optional dashboards for live monitoring (Grafana-compatible).
